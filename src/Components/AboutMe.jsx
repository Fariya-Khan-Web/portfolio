                    <p className='my-3'>Hi! I'm Sana, a 20 year old frontend developer. I have always been drawn to creativity, whether through art, design, or problem-solving. My passion for aesthetics and functionality naturally led me to web development.</p>
                    
                    <h3 className='text-xl md:text-2xl underline'>My Programming Journey</h3>
                    <p className=' my-3'>I started my coding journey with online courses and YouTube tutorials, exploring the endless possibilities of web development. Over time, I developed a love for crafting artistic, user-friendly websites that blend design with seamless functionality.</p>
                    
                    <h3 className='text-xl md:text-2xl underline'>Things I Do Beside Coading</h3>
                    <p className='my-3'>Beyond coding, I find inspiration in painting, where I can express my creativity in a different form. Iâ€™m also a Taekwondo player, which has taught me discipline, patience, and the importance of continuous learning. Additionally, I love reading books, as they open up new perspectives and fuel my creativity in both design and problem-solving.</p>
